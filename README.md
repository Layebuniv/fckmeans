This code presents two novel deterministic initialization procedures for K-means clustering based on
a modified crowding distance. The procedures, named CKmeans and FCKmeans, use more crowded
points as initial centroids. Experimental studies on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed
approach outperforms Kmeans and Kmeans++ in terms of clustering accuracy. The effectiveness of
CKmeans and FCKmeans is attributed to their ability to select better initial centroids based on the
modified crowding distance. Overall, the proposed approach provides a promising alternative for
improving Kmeans clustering.
