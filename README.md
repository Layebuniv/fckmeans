this code presents two novel deterministic initialization procedures for K-means clustering based on a modified crowding distance. The procedures, named CKmeans and FCKmeans, use more crowded points as initial centroids. Experimental studies on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms Kmeans and Kmeans++ in terms of clustering accuracy. The effectiveness of CKmeans and FCKmeans is attributed to their ability to select better initial centroids based on the modified crowding distance. Overall, the proposed approach provides a promising alternative for improving K-means clustering.
